        <div class="cont"> <p>Front-end web development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
           for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge 
           associated with front-end development is that the tools and techniques used to create 
          the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be 
          aware of how the field is developing.</p>
        <p>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the 
          information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact 
          that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing 
          the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that 
          their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform)
          and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>

        <div class="cont"> <p>The very beginning of web design was pretty dark, as screens were literally black
           and only few monochrome pixels lived therein. Design was made by symbols and tabulation (Tab key). So
            let's fast forward to the time when Graphic User Interface was the main way of surfing the web – the
             Wild West era of tables.</p>
            <p>The birth of browsers that could display images was the first step into web design as we know it. 
              The closest option available to structure information was the concept of tables already existing in HTML. 
              So putting tables within tables, figuring out clever ways to mix static cells with fluid cells was the thing,
              started by David's Siegel's book Creating Killer Sites. Though it didn’t feel totally right since the main purpose
              of a table is to structure numbers, it was still the common method to design the web for quite some time. The 
              other problem was the difficulty to maintain these fragile structures. This is also the time when the term slicing 
              designs became popular. Designers would make a fancy layout, but it was up to developers to break it into small pieces 
              and figure out the best way to make that design work. On the other hand, tables had some awesome features like the abilit
              y to align things vertically, be defined in pixels or in percentages. The main benefit was that it was the closest to a grid
               we could get back then. It was also the time when so many developers decided not to like front-end coding.</p>
              <p>JavaScript was the answer to the limitations of HTML. For instance, need a popup window, want to dynamically modify the
                 order of something? The answer was JavaScript. However, the main problem here is that JavaScript is layered on top of 
                 the fabric that makes the web work and has to be loaded separately. Very often it is used as an easy patch for a lazy 
                 developer, yet it is very powerful if used wisely. Nowadays we prefer to avoid JavaScript if the same feature can be 
                 delivered using CSS. Yet JavaScript itself stays strong as in front-end (jQuery) as on the back-end (Node.js).

          <div class="thome"> <strong>How it works</strong> </div>
          <div class="cont"><p>There are several tools available that can be used to develop the front end of a website, and understanding which tools are best fit for specific tasks marks the difference between developing a hacked site and a well designed, scalable site.

              <p><strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong></p>
              HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process, without which a web page doesn't exist. Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another webpage. A markup language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3 recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.It is very useful in creating web pages.
              
              <p><strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong></p>
              Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does this by maintaining style sheets which sit on top of other style rules and are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and resolution.
              
              <p><strong>JavaScript</strong></p>
              JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to events, like user input.
              
              Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web (independent of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well, adding a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience.</p></div>
